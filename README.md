# F.R.I.D.A.Y. — Tony Stark Demo

> *"Fully Responsive Intelligent Digital Assistant for You"*

A Tony Stark-inspired AI assistant split into two cooperating pieces:

| Component | What it is |
|-----------|-----------|
| **MCP Server** (`uv run friday`) | A [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server that exposes tools (news, web search, system info, …) over SSE. Think of it as the Stark Industries backend — it does the actual work. |
| **Voice Agent** (`uv run friday_voice`) | A [LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents) voice pipeline that listens to your microphone, reasons with an LLM (OpenAI `gpt-4o` by default), and speaks back with OpenAI TTS — all while pulling tools from the MCP server in real time. |
| **Desktop App** (`uv run friday_desktop`) | A frameless PySide6 window with animated FRIDAY orb, chat transcript, and live operational feed. It can chat directly, and it mirrors live voice-agent transcript/state/tool events. |

## How it works

```
Microphone ──► STT (Sarvam Saaras v3)
                    │
                    ▼
             LLM (OpenAI gpt-4o)     ◄──────► MCP Server (FastMCP / SSE)
                    │                              ├─ get_world_news
                    ▼                              ├─ open_world_monitor
             TTS (OpenAI nova)                     ├─ search_web
                    │                              └─ …more tools
                    ▼
             Speaker / LiveKit room
```

The voice agent connects to the MCP server via SSE at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse` (auto-resolved to the Windows host IP when running inside WSL).

## Quick start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.11
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — `pip install uv` or `curl -Lsf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- A [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io) project (free tier works)

### 2. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAGAR-TAMANG/friday-tony-stark-demo.git
cd friday-tony-stark-demo
uv sync          # creates .venv and installs all dependencies
```

### 3. Set up environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your API keys (see the section below)
```

### 4. Run — two terminals

**Terminal 1 — MCP server** (must start first)

```bash
uv run friday
```

Starts the FastMCP server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse`. The voice agent connects here to fetch its tools.

**Terminal 2 — Voice agent**

```bash
uv run friday_voice
```

Starts the LiveKit voice agent in **dev mode** — it joins a LiveKit room and begins listening. Open the [LiveKit Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io) and connect to your room to talk to FRIDAY.

## `uv run friday` vs `uv run friday_voice`

| Command | Entry point | What it does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `uv run friday` | `server.py → main()` | Launches the **FastMCP server** over SSE transport on port 8000. This is the "brain backend" — it registers all tools, prompts, and resources that the LLM can call. |
| `uv run friday_voice` | `agent_friday.py → dev()` | Launches the **LiveKit voice agent**. It builds the STT / LLM / TTS pipeline, connects to your LiveKit room, and wires up the MCP server as a tool source. The `dev()` wrapper auto-injects the `dev` CLI flag so you don't have to type it manually. |
| `uv run friday_desktop` | `friday.desktop.app → main()` | Launches the desktop UI. It can run standalone, and when `uv run friday_voice` is active it mirrors live voice transcript, state, and tool events. |

> Both processes must run **simultaneously**. The voice agent calls the MCP server in real time whenever it needs a tool (e.g. fetching news).

## Mac automation permissions

For the human-worker tools, macOS may prompt for:

- **Screen Recording** — needed for `describe_screen`.
- **Accessibility** — needed for confirmed click/type/key actions.
- **Automation** — needed for Messages/System Events/WhatsApp control.

Risky actions are prepared first and require confirmation before execution.

Messages use the same confirmation broker: `prepare_message` creates a pending action, then `confirm_message_action` sends only after explicit confirmation. For named Apple Messages recipients, `prepare_message` searches Contacts first and includes the resolved contact in the preview; ambiguous or missing contacts do not create a pending send. WhatsApp resolves Contacts phone numbers first, then sends through the WhatsApp URL flow after confirmation; if no phone is available, it can use a confirmed WhatsApp app search. If no `action_id` is passed, confirmation executes the newest pending message, so a natural "yes, send it" works.

The LiveKit voice agent starts asleep and stays silent. Say `wake up, daddy's home` or `daddy's home` to wake FRIDAY; normal speech before that is ignored.

---

## Desktop app

Run:

```bash
uv run friday_desktop
```

This opens a local FRIDAY window with animated orb, transcript, text input, and tool-call activity feed. It works standalone, and also mirrors the live voice agent when `uv run friday_voice` is running.

---

## Memory, diagnostics, and web

The merged project includes two memory surfaces:

- `remember_in_obsidian` / `search_obsidian_memory` store explicit notes under the SecBrain project folder.
- `save_memory`, `update_profile`, `recall_recent`, `search_memory`, `read_note`, and `list_notes` use an imported `Memory/` folder inside `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`.

Diagnostics tools are read-only:

- `run_diagnostics`
- `top_processes`
- `network_scan`

`search_web` now uses DuckDuckGo HTML results instead of returning a stub.

---

## Switching providers

Open `agent_friday.py` and change the provider constants at the top:

```python
STT_PROVIDER = "sarvam"   # "sarvam" | "whisper"
LLM_PROVIDER = "openai"   # "openai" | "gemini"
TTS_PROVIDER = "openai"   # "openai" | "sarvam"
```

---

## Adding a new tool

1. Create or open a file in `friday/tools/`
2. Define a `register(mcp)` function and decorate tools with `@mcp.tool()`
3. Import and call `register(mcp)` inside `friday/tools/__init__.py`

The MCP server will pick it up on next start.
